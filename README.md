NOT REPONSIVE 

I use this personal project to teach absolute beginners how to think and develop a basic front-end app in vanilla JS / HTML / CSS. 
<b>No framework, no fancy look, just the core of it.</b>

>Everything JS is stacked inside just one file to avoid confusing students with export/import 

>Apes a map use case without using map by hard coding keys into each div

>A few code lines are useless as such, they are meant to show a few use cases through console.log() at different steps of the process of ordering items

Will add step-by-step instructions to complete the project, each corresponding to a skill level.
Might add a basic back-end infrastructure to keep order history and/or create client account.
